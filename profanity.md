# Profanity

**Source code**: [github.com/pestphp/pest-plugin-profanity](https://github.com/pestphp/pest-plugin-profanity)

The Profanity plugin will scan your codebase for profanity in places like comments, constants and properties. This can
help you maintain a more professional and respectful codebase. As developers, we've all faced moments of frustration, 
whether it be debugging a persistent issue or trying to decipher confusing code written by someone else. These moments 
can sometimes result in the inclusion of profanity in your code.

To start using Pest's Profanity plugin, you need to require the plugin via Composer.

```bash
composer require pestphp/pest-plugin-profanity --dev
```

After requiring the plugin, you may utilize the `--profanity` option to generate a report of your profanity.

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --profanity
```

Profanity does not require you to write any tests. Instead, it analyses your codebase and generates a report of your 
profanity. This report will display a list of files and their corresponding profanity results.

If any of your files contain profanity, they will be highlighted in red and displayed using their respective line
numbers and the profane word(s) that have been found.

As an example, `pr31(fuck)` means that the word "fuck" was found on line 31.

## Specific Language

Often, a codebase is a single language, so you would only want to flag profanity for the language of the codebase. To 
do this, you can use the `--language` option:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --profanity --language=en
```

The example above would only find English profanity. We currently support: `ar`, `da`, `en`, `it`, `nl` and `pt_BR`.

## Include Words

There may be times when you want to flag certain words specific to your application as profane. To do this, you can use 
the `--include` option:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --profanity --include=elephpant
```

## Exclude Words

There may be times when you want to exclude certain from being flagged up as profane. To do this, you can use the 
`--exclude` option:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --profanity --include=exclude
```

## Compact Output

Often, when checking for profanity, you only want to see files that do contain profanity. To do this, you can use
the `--compact` option:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --profanity --compact
```

## Different Formats

In addition, Pest supports reporting the profanity results to a specific file:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --profanity --output=my-report.json
```
